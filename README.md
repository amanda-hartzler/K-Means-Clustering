# K-Means-Clustering
The goal of this analysis is to use k-means to cluster customers into groups based on their age and tenure with the company. It costs more money for the company to recruit new customers than to retain old customers. Knowing what customers fall into each age/tenure length category can help the company with targeted marketing and increasing profits.
